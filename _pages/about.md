I am Yuxin (Vivian) Zhou, a senior Ph.D. candidate in **Quantitative Finance** at Université de Lyon & EMLYON business school, affiliated with the [AIM Quant Center](https://aim.em-lyon.com/quant/) and [Coactis Research Lab](https://coactis.org/). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Guillaume Coqueret](https://www.gcoqueret.com/), the head of AIM Quant Center, EMLYON business school. 

My research focuses on **Sustainability**, **Energy Risk**, **Financial Market**, **Geopolitics** and **Political Finance**, integrating quantitative finance, econometrics, especially **panel data analysis** to address complex financial phenomena. I am particularly interested in the impact of sustainability or energy consumption on asset prices during big political events.

Thesis (Working in Progress)
======

**Title: Sustainability, Commodites and Geopolitics.**

In my thesis, I define the sustainability of commodities through its carbon and water footprints. I study the diversification benefits brought by green commodities to the current stock-bond green portfolios.

I also explore the role of ESG during geopolitical events like Ukraine-Russia conflict. 

In the last chapter, I study the differences in corporate sustainability among enterprises under state jurisdictions controlled by different political parties.

I enjoy experiencing different cultures. Hence, I pursued my degree and extra trainings in various countries.
